# Image-Compression-using-k-means-algorithm
Image Compression is a type of data compression applied to digital images, to reduce their cost for storage or transmissions. 
The algorithm used for this is through K-Means Clustering.
The code shows pre-processing high-resolution image data for k-means clustering, conducting basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization, applying a computationally time-efficient implementation of the k-means algorithm, Mini-Batch K-Means, to compress images, and leverage the Jupyter widgets library to build interactive GUI components to select images from a drop-down list and pick values of k using a slider.
